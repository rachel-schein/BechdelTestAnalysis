Bechdel Analysis Project
Dataset originally from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bechdel
Based on this article https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/

As my first solo data science project I recreated the analysis and visualizations in the article above. 
The findings are presented in a report located in the "6. Final" folder.

Tools:
Visual Studio 2022 to upload the data into a databse
SQL Server Management Studio 19 to clean the data and filter movies from 1990 onwards
python (To move the dubious movies from the FAIL to PASS category)
Tableau to create visualizations
