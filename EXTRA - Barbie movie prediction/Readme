Fun little exercise where I trained a linear regression model only with the films that PASS the test to predict how much the barbie movie would make based only on its budget.
The result was that the movie actually grossed 5 times the predicted amount based on the model.
The other outlier that sits on the top right of the chart is a pirates of the caribbean movie.

Clearly budget is only one among the sea of factors that predict a movie's success in the box office.
